# MacPorts Ports

This branch of MacPorts repo has fixes specific for macOS 10.6 PowerPC (10A190).
While most of these are compatible with 10.5.8 and 10.6.8 Rosetta, only 10.6 PPC is supported here.

There is no implication of all broken ports to be fixed, however this is intended to be a fully-functional set-up.
If something fails for you on 10.6 PPC, please report here.
